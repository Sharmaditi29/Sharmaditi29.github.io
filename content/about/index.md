Namastey🙏!! Hello👋 !!! Moin👋!!!

I am Aditi Sharma, a nature enthusiast, love for science and research!Since childhood, I have been among those kids where people are mostly annoyed,Why??? Because I always asked a lot of questions!!! Starting from asking questions to start finding an answer on my own, I started a journey in research as a PhD student.

Find more about me and my several experiences of my journey abroad!!!
Enjoyy!!!
