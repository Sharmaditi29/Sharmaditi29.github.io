{{< title4 "Hello!" >}}

Namastey🙏!! Hello👋 !!! Moin👋!!!

I am Aditi Sharma, a nature enthusiast, science lover and a full-time researcher.Since childhood, I've been one of those kids who annoyed people because I always asked a lot of questions. Starting from asking questions to start finding an answer on my own, I started a journey in research as a PhD student.

Find more about me and my several experiences of my journey abroad!!!
Enjoyy!!!
